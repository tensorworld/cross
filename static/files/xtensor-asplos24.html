<p>Tensor problems are becoming ever more important to represent data and analyze its inherent properties, as the correlation of data gains importance in many domains. The application of tensor methods covers machine learning/deep learning, quantum chemistry/physics, quantum circuit simulation, social networks, and healthcare, to name a few. The research on tensor methods comes from multiple domains, including computer architecture, programming languages, compilers, and parallel computing.  This workshop aims to gather researchers from diverse computer system backgrounds to present and communicate their work on tensor methods, and then seek a cross-stack solution to improve the performance of tensor algorithms.</p>

	<li>2:30 - 2:45 pm: A Novel Sparse Tensor Representation for Quantum Simulations, by Srikar Chundury</br></br>
	<strong>Abstract:</strong> Digital simulation of quantum systems is important for algorithmic development and quantum device verification. We present a novel sparse tensor format, DiaQ, specifically catering to state vector quantum simulation.We develop a set of numerical methods fundamental to state simulation with lower algorithmic complexity than their dense counterparts and provide an implementation in C++ with parallelization over multicores and vectorization. Experiments of sparse DiaQ indicate significant performance benefits over equivalent quantum simulations with a dense tensor format for various benchmark circuits particularly for larger number of qubits. </br>

	<li>2:45 - 3:00 pm: Accelerating GEMV via Targeted Tensor Core Optimizations, by Sounder Rajendran</br></br>
	<strong>Abstract:</strong> This work explores the acceleration of General Matrix-Vector Multiplication (GEMV) through the use of specialized matrix processing units, known as Tensor Cores, available in NVIDIA GPUs starting from the Volta architecture. With GEMV’s extensive application in High-Performance Computing (HPC) and Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning (AI/ML), from backpropagation in neural networks to iterative solvers in computational fluid dynamics, the operation’s efficiency is pivotal. Our research centers on novel matrix augmentation and transformation techniques that adapt GEMV computations for Tensor Cores, focusing on minimizing FLOPS loss and leveraging shared memory optimizations. This adaptation seeks to exploit the high-throughput capabilities of Tensor Cores, traditionally utilized for matrix-matrix multiplication (GEMM), thus extending their utility to accelerate GEMV operations. Preliminary findings demonstrate significant speedups in GEMV execution compared to conventional cuBLAS implementations, underscoring the potential of our approach in unlocking new dimensions of computational performance for a wide array of HPC and AI/ML applications. Through this exploration, we aim to further contribute to the optimization of GEMV, facilitating more efficient utilization of advanced hardware accelerations.</br>

	<li>3:30 - 4:10 pm: <strong>Invited Talk by Xupeng Miao @ CMU </strong></br></br>
	<strong>Title:</strong> Toward Fast and Affordable Serving Systems for Large Language Models </br>
	<strong>Abstract:</strong> In the rapidly evolving field of generative artificial intelligence, efficient deployment of large language models (LLMs) is a critical challenge. In this talk, I will introduce our three innovative approaches to enhancing the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of LLM inference and serving systems. First, I will present SpecInfer, the inaugural tree-based speculative inference system that reduces LLM serving latency by 1.5-3.5x compared to existing solutions by leveraging a novel token tree speculation and verification mechanism. Next, I will describe SpotServe, the first LLM serving system on spot instances, handling preemptions with dynamic reparallelization, ensuring relatively low tail latency, and reducing monetary cost by 54%. Finally, I will exhibit FlexLLM, a low-cost co-serving system for LLM inference and parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT), achieving higher fine-tuning throughput, while preserving the SLA for inference jobs.</br>

	<li>4:10 - 4:25 pm: Optimizing Sparse Tensor-times-Vector on Cerebras WSE-2, by Sai Krishna Teja Varma Manthena</br></br>
	<strong>Abstract:</strong> Sparse tensor algebra plays a crucial role in various domains such as scientific computing, machine learning, and data analytics, particularly in computations like Sparse Tensor-times-Vector (SpTTV), essential for popular tensor decompositions such as Tucker decomposition and Tensor Power Iteration. This work delves into the optimization of the SpTTV kernel specifically on the Cerebras Wafer-Scale Engine (WSE), a powerful architecture initially designed for machine learning training but increasingly recognized for its versatility across different workloads. Our evaluation, conducted on a 13th Gen Intel(R) Core(TM) i9-13900F with a clock speed of 2000 MHz, compares our optimized implementation against PASTA library’s OpenMP implementation of the SpTTV kernel. The results demonstrate significant performance improvements, achieving upto 4× speed up for a synthetic 50×50×50 tensor generated with non-zeros ranging from 128 to 32768 using upto 256 Processing Elements (PEs), and 3.5× speedup for a synthetic 68×68×68 tensor generated ranging from 128 to 16384 non-zeros using upto 128 PEs. This work attempts to showcase the potential of the Cerebras WSE in accelerating sparse tensor computations and advancing highperformance computing paradigms.</br>
